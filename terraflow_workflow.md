# Terraform Workflow

#### Beginning of project
This "initialises" the terraform file and downloads the required provider code
```$ terraform init```

#### Format terraform files
a consistent format makes it easier to read and/or debug
```$ terraform fmt```

#### See changes made to infrastructure
shows the changes, additions or deletions made since previous deployment
```$ terraform plan```

#### Deploy the infrastructure
```$ terraform apply```

#### Destroy infrastructure
```$ terraform destroy```
