# Learning Terraform
I am learning Terraform as a useful tool to be used in my learning at becoming a better Data Engineer.
The fact that it can be used at work is definitely a plus.

The cloud has made it easier to spin up some infrastructure at a low cost, in order
to work on a solution in real life - no longer toy problems.
I plan to to be able to make my solutions or experiments reproducible. Having all the code available on Github as well as the setting up of the infrastructure makes it super easy for the next person to improve on it.

This goes way beyond having a Docker container :)

<add more here as I experience and learn more...>
